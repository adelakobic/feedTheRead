# feedTheRead 🥙😋🗒
Using Node.js to create a README generator. 

## Description 📜
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to include a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions&mdash;to increase the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. 

This application will  quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

## Motivation 💪🏻
This app will help to generate a good quality README document so that developers can quickly create a professional README for a new project.
